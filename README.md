<h3> Implementation of computer geometry algorithms (Spring 2013) </h3>

Algorithms covered:
<ul>
<li> Jarvis March (Gift wrapping) (2D Convex Hull) </li>
<li> Graham's scan (2D Convex Hull) </li>
<li> Quickhull (2D Convex Hull) </li>
<li> Intersection finding </li>
<li> KD Tree Closest Point Finding </li>
<li> Test of Containment (test if a points are in or out of polygon) </li>
<li> Triangulation </li>
</ul>

All algorithms are implemented in C# and except test of containment all of them have interactive interface.<br/>
Programs are developed in Slovenian language as part of Introduction to Computational Geometry class in spring 2013.
